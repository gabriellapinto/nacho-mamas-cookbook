## About this Application
Nacho Mama's Cookbook is a user-friendly application that reflects an old fashioned cookbook. The user would need to login on the homepage and would then be redirected to the main cookbook page. There, they can choose to add a recipe, view their current recipes, or delete a recipe. In each recipe, the user can input ingredients, directions, and even notes about the recipe to remember.
